        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil Sampalok:</strong> Add water and sampalok to a large pot over high heat. Bring to a boil until sampalok turns soft, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and strain the sampalok, saving the water. Once sampalok is cool enough to handle, remove as much peel as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Mash and strain sampalok:</strong> Mash tamarind pulp with a fork until smooth. Pass the pulp through a fine mesh strainer or cheescloth, then add the liquid to the tamarind broth. Repeat until liquid has been fully extracted from the pulp.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook aromatics and pork:</strong> Add oil to a larage pot over medium-high heat. Cook tomatoes, red onion, and garlic until softened. Add 8 cups of tamarind broth and stir. Season with salt as needed. Once liquid is boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and add pork. Cook until fork-tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook vegetables:</strong> Add vegetables in stages to prevent overcooking. Start with chilies to infuse the broth, then go from hard to soft, leafy vegetaables: radish, eggplant, sitaw, and kangkong. Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer sinigang to a bowl. Serve hot with patis and steamed rice on the side.</li>
        </ol>
